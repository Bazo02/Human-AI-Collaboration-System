    <h1>Guidelines</h1>

    <p>
        Please read the guidelines below before starting. This ensures that all participants have the same understanding of the task.
    </p>

    <div class="case-box">
        <h2>1) Your task</h2>
        <p>
            You will review loan applications and choose one decision for each case:
            <strong>Approve</strong> or <strong>Reject</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>2) What “Approve” and “Reject” mean</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Approve</strong> means you believe the applicant should be granted the loan.
            <strong>Reject</strong> means you believe the applicant should not be granted the loan.
        </p>

        <h2>3) Interpreting the applicant information</h2>
        <p>
            The application shows the same fields for each case. Some values may indicate higher or lower risk.
            Use your own judgment based on the information shown.
        </p>

        <h2>4) AI support (second part of the study)</h2>
        <p>
            In the second part, the interface will include an <strong>AI Recommendation</strong>.
            The AI provides advice only. <strong>You are responsible for the final decision.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>5) AI confidence</h2>
        <p>
            The AI also shows a <strong>Confidence</strong> value (percentage). This represents how confident the AI is in its recommendation for that case.
        </p>

        <h2>6) Decision threshold</h2>
        <p>
            The AI converts its internal score into a suggested decision using a fixed threshold.
            For this study, the threshold is <strong>{{ (approval_threshold * 100)|round(0) }}%</strong>.
            This means that when the AI’s estimated probability of approval is at least this threshold, it suggests <strong>Approve</strong>; otherwise it suggests <strong>Reject</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>7) Take your time, but do not overthink</h2>
        <p>
            Work steadily and make the best decision you can for each case.
        </p>
